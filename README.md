# JS Background Colour Switcher ðŸŽ¨





*Try clicking the color buttons to change the background color of the page!*

## What is this project?

This simple web app lets **you** change the pageâ€™s background color by clicking color buttons. The headings automatically adjust their color for good contrast. When you hover over the navigation bar, the background temporarily changes to a highlight color and reverts to your chosen color when you move your mouse away.

## Why would you want this?

Sometimes websites have fixed backgrounds, but what if you want to pick your own? This project shows you how to dynamically change page colors without reloading. It also ensures text stays readable by adjusting heading colors based on your choice.

  - Handling clicks and mouse events
  - Dynamically changing styles
  - Managing the current background color state
  - Using clean, readable `switch` statements

buttons.forEach(btn => {
  btn.addEventListener('click', e => {
    const color = e.currentTarget.id;
    currentColor = color;
